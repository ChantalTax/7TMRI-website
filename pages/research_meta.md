The Metabolic Imaging group aims at developing robust and highly sensitive metabolic imaging methods at ultra-high field for application in clinical studies on cancer, brain disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease and muscle (patho)physiology.

The MRS-group develops 1H, 2H, 31P, 13C, 19F and 23Na metabolic imaging methods in the brain and body for use at ultra-high field (7 Tesla) MR systems.


Principal investigators:

- ***Jannie Wijnen*** (scientific manager)  
Robust and fast metabolic imaging methods for pediatric metabolic disorders and brain tumors.

- ***Jeanine Prompers*** (scientific director)  
MR imaging and spectroscopy of metabolism and mitochondrial function in metabolic disorders.

- ***Alex Bhogal***  
Functional metabolic imaging of cerebral physiology in brain disorders
Metabolic Imaging methods in brain and body  ultra-high field (7 Tesla) MR systems
