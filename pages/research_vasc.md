The mission of the Vascular Brain Imaging group is to develop highly sensitive and precise high-field MRI methods that specifically focus on the cerebrovascular structure and function.
These methods are then applied in brain imaging for both healthy individuals and those affected by various diseases.
{% include page-image im_id="over" %}

Developments encompass hardware, MRI and fMRI data acquisition methods, analysis methods, and biophysical and computational models.
Applications encompass neurological and cerebrovascular diseases, neurovascular coupling, and neuroscience.

Principal investigators:

- ***Jeroen Siero (PI, Scientific Manager)***  
High-field methods to investigate brain physiology related to perfusion, oxygen metabolism, and neurovascular coupling.
The focus is on high-resolution and fast and silent scanning using state-of-the-art hardware such as (ultrasonic) insert gradient coils.

- ***Jaco Zwanenburg (PI, Scientific Director)***  
High-field methods targeting vascular- and intracranial fluid dynamics including brain waste clearance, for the study of cerebral small vessel disease.
