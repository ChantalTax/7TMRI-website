The Vascular Brain Imaging groupâ€™s mission is the development of high field MRI methods that target the cerebrovascular structure and function with high sensitivity and precision, and their application in brain imaging in health and disease.

{% include page-images %}

Developments encompass hardware, MRI and fMRI data acquisition methods, analysis methods, and biophysical, computational models.

Applications encompass neurological and cerebrovascular diseases, neurovascular coupling, and neuroscience.

Principal investigators:

- ***Jeroen Siero (Scientific Manager, PI)***  
High resolution 4D vascular imaging and analysis methods for unraveling brain physiology of hemodynamics in diseases.

- ***Jaco Zwanenburg***  
High field methods targeting vascular- and intracranial fluid dynamics including brain waste clearance, for the study of cerebral small vessel disease.

- ***Natalia Petridou (PI***  
High field high resolution functional and structural MRI, neurovascular coupling, neuroscience.
