The [pre-clinical imaging group](https://dijkhuizenlab.nl/) develops and apply magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) methods to study human diseases, with a particular focus on brain disorders, in a preclinical setting.

The main research areas are:
–  [Diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders](https://dijkhuizenlab.nl/diagnosis/)
–  [Structure and function of neural networks](https://dijkhuizenlab.nl/structure-and-function-of-neural-networks/)
–  [Stroke recovery, neuroplasticity and brain stimulation](https://dijkhuizenlab.nl/stroke-recovery-neuroplasticity-and-brain-stimulation-2/)

the laboratory is equipped with two state-of-the-art animal MR systems with field strengths of 9.4 T and 7 T. In addition, in vivo optical imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) set-ups are available for multimodal studies.
